# CEVA_Case_Study

The goal of this case study is to predict the delay that a shipment from a supplier to a customer can have.
You will find the exploratory data analysis in the "notebooks" folder and the script to make a prediction in the "src" folder. The csv generated will be in the "data" folder with the date and time of edition.
